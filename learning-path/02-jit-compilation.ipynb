    "# 📘 Notebook 2: JIT Compilation - Making Your Code Blazing Fast\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the \"speed\" chapter of JAX! This notebook teaches you how to make your code **10-100x faster** using JIT compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What You'll Learn (30-40 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll understand:\n",
    "- ✅ What JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation is and why it's powerful\n",
    "- ✅ How to use `@jax.jit` to accelerate code\n",
    "- ✅ **Critical pitfalls** that break JIT (and how to avoid them)\n",
    "- ✅ When JIT helps (and when it doesn't)\n",
    "- ✅ How to debug JIT issues\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤔 What is JIT Compilation?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem: Python is Slow\n",
    "Regular Python code is **interpreted** - executed line by line at runtime. This is flexible but slow for numerical computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: JIT Compilation\n",
    "**JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation** converts your Python function to **optimized machine code** that runs directly on your hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How JIT Works (4 Steps):\n",
    "1. **Trace**: First time you call a JIT function, JAX traces it to understand what it does\n",
    "2. **Compile**: JAX compiles it to optimized machine code using XLA\n",
    "3. **Cache**: The compiled version is cached for reuse\n",
    "4. **Execute**: Future calls use the fast compiled version\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@jax.jit  # This decorator enables JIT compilation\n",
    "def fast_function(x):\n",
    "    return x ** 2 + 2 * x + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# First call: Traces, compiles, executes (slow)\n",
    "result = fast_function(5.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Second call: Uses cached compiled version (FAST!)\n",
    "result = fast_function(10.0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Speedup\n",
    "- **Small arrays**: 2-5x faster\n",
    "- **Medium arrays**: 10-50x faster\n",
    "- **Large arrays**: 50-100x faster\n",
    "- **Complex operations**: Can be 1000x+ faster!\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ JIT Pitfalls (Very Important!)\n",
    "\n",
    "JIT is powerful but has **strict requirements**. The #1 source of JAX errors!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pitfall #1: Data-Dependent Control Flow ❌\n",
    "**This FAILS:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@jax.jit\n",
    "def broken(x):\n",
    "    if x > 0:  # ❌ Control flow depends on x's VALUE\n",
    "        return x * 2\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return x * 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?** During tracing, JAX doesn't know x's value - only its shape and type!\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Fix:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@jax.jit\n",
    "def works(x):\n",
    "    return jnp.where(x > 0, x * 2, x * 3)  # ✅ JAX-compatible\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pitfall #2: Side Effects Don't Work ❌\n",
    "**This FAILS (or behaves unexpectedly):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@jax.jit\n",
    "def broken(x):\n",
    "    print(f\"x = {x}\")  # ❌ Only prints ONCE (during tracing)\n",
    "    global counter\n",
    "    counter += 1  # ❌ Global state isn't updated\n",
    "    return x * 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?** JIT traces once, then reuses the compiled code. Side effects only happen during tracing!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pitfall #3: Dynamic Shapes ❌\n",
    "JIT requires shapes to be known at compile time. Dynamic shapes break this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pitfall #4: In-Place Mutations ❌\n",
    "Remember from Notebook 1? JAX arrays are immutable. Use `.at[].set()` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎓 What's in This Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Performance comparisons** - JIT vs non-JIT (see the speedup!)\n",
    "2. **Understanding async execution** - Why `.block_until_ready()` matters\n",
    "3. **JAXPR inspection** - Peek under the hood\n",
    "4. **Common pitfalls** - Data-dependent control flow, side effects\n",
    "5. **Debugging JIT issues** - How to fix errors\n",
    "6. **When NOT to use JIT** - Compilation overhead vs benefit\n",
    "7. **Quick reference guide** - JAX-compatible control flow\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this notebook, you should:\n",
    "- ✅ Complete Notebook 1 (JAX Basics)\n",
    "- ✅ Understand what a function is\n",
    "- ✅ Know basic Python control flow (if/else, loops)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "**JIT = Tracing → Compiling → Caching → Fast Execution**\n",
    "\n",
    "The first call is slow (compilation), but subsequent calls are **blazing fast**!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see it in action! 🔥"
