    "# JIT Compilation in JAX - Deep Dive\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is JIT Compilation?\n",
    "\n",
    "**JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation** is JAX's way of optimizing your code for maximum performance. When you decorate a function with `@jax.jit`, JAX:\n",
    "1. **Traces** your function with abstract values to understand its structure\n",
    "2. **Compiles** it to highly optimized machine code using XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra)\n",
    "3. **Caches** the compiled version for reuse\n",
    "4. **Executes** the optimized code on subsequent calls\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this: regular Python executes line-by-line (interpreted), while JIT-compiled code is translated into super-fast machine instructions that run directly on your hardware (CPU/GPU/TPU).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use JIT?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Speed**: 10x-100x faster for numerical computations\n",
    "- **Hardware acceleration**: Automatically leverages GPUs/TPUs\n",
    "- **Optimization**: XLA fuses operations and eliminates redundant computations\n",
    "- **Parallelization**: Automatically parallelizes independent operations\n",
    "\n",
    "## When JIT Compilation FAILS or Behaves Unexpectedly\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ 1. DATA-DEPENDENT CONTROL FLOW (The Key Issue!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is what your tutorial was referring to!** You CANNOT use regular Python `if/else` statements that depend on **array values**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ THIS WILL FAIL OR BEHAVE INCORRECTLY:\n",
    "@jax.jit\n",
    "def bad_function(x):\n",
    "    if x > 0:  # ❌ Control flow depends on the VALUE of x\n",
    "        return x * 2\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return x * 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?** During tracing, JAX doesn't know the actual value of `x` - it only knows its shape and type. So it can't decide which branch to take!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Use JAX's special control flow operations:\n",
    "- `jnp.where(condition, true_val, false_val)` - for element-wise conditionals\n",
    "- `jax.lax.cond(pred, true_fun, false_fun, operand)` - for scalar conditionals\n",
    "- `jax.lax.switch()` - for multiple branches\n",
    "- `jax.lax.select()` - for choosing between values\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ✅ THIS WORKS:\n",
    "@jax.jit\n",
    "def good_function(x):\n",
    "    return jnp.where(x > 0, x * 2, x * 3)  # ✅ JAX-compatible conditional\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ 2. PYTHON SIDE EFFECTS\n",
    "\n",
    "Side effects are operations that modify state outside the function or interact with the external world:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ THESE DON'T WORK AS EXPECTED IN JIT:\n",
    "@jax.jit\n",
    "def has_side_effects(x):\n",
    "    print(f\"Value is {x}\")  # ❌ Print only happens during tracing!\n",
    "    global counter\n",
    "    counter += 1  # ❌ Modifying global state\n",
    "    my_list.append(x)  # ❌ Modifying external data structures\n",
    "    return x * 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?** JIT traces the function ONCE, then caches the compiled version. Side effects only execute during tracing, not during every call!\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens:**\n",
    "- `print()` statements execute only the first time (during tracing)\n",
    "- Global variables are captured at trace time, not updated during execution\n",
    "- File I/O, database calls, etc. won't work as expected\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ 3. DATA-DEPENDENT LOOPS\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ THIS FAILS:\n",
    "@jax.jit\n",
    "def bad_loop(x):\n",
    "    for i in range(int(x)):  # ❌ Loop count depends on x's value\n",
    "        x = x + 1\n",
    "    return x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Use `jax.lax.fori_loop()` or `jax.lax.while_loop()` for dynamic loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ 4. SHAPE-CHANGING OPERATIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ THIS FAILS:\n",
    "@jax.jit\n",
    "def dynamic_shape(x):\n",
    "    if x.sum() > 0:\n",
    "        return x[:10]  # Shape changes based on condition\n",
    "    return x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "JIT requires shapes to be known at compile time. Dynamic shapes break this requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ 5. IN-PLACE MUTATIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ THIS FAILS:\n",
    "@jax.jit\n",
    "def mutate_array(x):\n",
    "    x[0] = 10  # ❌ JAX arrays are immutable!\n",
    "    return x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Use `.at[].set()` syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ✅ THIS WORKS:\n",
    "@jax.jit\n",
    "def update_array(x):\n",
    "    return x.at[0].set(10)  # ✅ Returns new array\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use JIT\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **USE JIT FOR:**\n",
    "- Pure functions (no side effects)\n",
    "- Functions operating on JAX arrays\n",
    "- Numerical computations (matrix operations, neural networks, simulations)\n",
    "- Functions called repeatedly with similar input shapes\n",
    "- Performance-critical code\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **DON'T USE JIT FOR:**\n",
    "- Functions with print/debug statements\n",
    "- Code that modifies global state\n",
    "- Functions with Python control flow depending on array values\n",
    "- Small, one-off computations (compilation overhead > benefit)\n",
    "- Code interacting with external systems (files, databases, APIs)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Keep functions pure**: Input → Output, no side effects\n",
    "2. **Use JAX control flow**: `jnp.where()`, `jax.lax.cond()`, etc.\n",
    "3. **Warm up the JIT**: Run once before timing to avoid compilation overhead\n",
    "4. **Use `.block_until_ready()`**: JAX executes asynchronously by default\n",
    "5. **Inspect with `jax.make_jaxpr()`**: See the intermediate representation\n",
    "6. **Static arguments**: Use `static_argnums` for non-array arguments\n",
